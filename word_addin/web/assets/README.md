# Word Add-in Icons

This directory should contain icon files for the Word add-in. The manifest.xml file references the following icon files:

- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixel icon
- `icon-64.png` - 64x64 pixel icon

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The icons should be:

- Square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- PNG format with transparency
- Simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Consistent with your brand identity

## Placeholder Icons

For testing purposes, you can use placeholder icons:

1. Visit a site like [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/) or [PlaceIMG](https://placeimg.com/)
2. Generate placeholder images with the correct dimensions (32x32 and 64x64)
3. Save them to this directory with the correct filenames
